# A11y best practices

Here you will find resources and examples of how to make your website accessible

## Introduction

**Fun fact**:

The word accessibility is abbreviated to "a11y" with the number eleven in the middle referring to the number of letters that the word contains between the first and last letter. It follows an Information and Communications Technology (ICT)-oriented convention, just like internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n), which are used mostly in the software community.

**Goal**:
a11y aims at helping developers create software that can be used by people with disabilities. This is based on [webaim](https://webaim.org/)'s mission.
